# Hi there!

## I'm Julia Britland, an aspiring software/data engineer.

### My story:

I am from Utah, USA, but I am now based in London, England. I trained as a dietitian in the United States with a **BS in Food and Nutrition** from the University of Alabama and a **dietetic internship** completed at Virginia State University and gained my status as a **Registered Dietetian** in the United States in 2022. I enjoy spending time with my husband Curtis ‚ù§Ô∏è, cooking/baking üç™, traveling ‚úàÔ∏è, playing video games üéÆ, reading classic novels üìñ, walks in the park üå≥, and West End theatre productions üé≠. I have always also been interested in data and technology and how they can be used to solve big problems, and this is why I recently decided to transition to a career in the tech field.

### My skills and learning:

In the last year, I have taken several steps to launch my career in tech.

#### Software Engineering Bootcamp

I started by completing **HyperionDev**'s Software Engineering Bootcamp from December 2022 to January 2023, which was co-certified by the **University of Manchester**. During this full-time two-month bootcamp, I developed the following skills:
- **Python** basics
- Database management with **Python SQLite**
- Front-end development with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Bootstrap**
- Web development with **Django**
- Natural Language Processing with **SpaCy**
- Source version control with **Git**

I created several apps during this bootcamp: 
- A console-based [Bookstore Manager App](https://github.com/jmbritland/BookstoreManager) using SQLite
- A console-based [Warehouse Inventory Manager App](https://github.com/jmbritland/finalCapstone) using txt file handling

#### Pioneers Program

I then joined the **Albany Beck Technology Pioneers** program in January 2023. This full-time three-month program gave me hands-on experience working independently and with others to produce console-based apps, web-based apps, and web services using the following technologies and methodologies:
- **Java** with **Spring**, **Spring Boot**, and **Maven**
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- Multi-tiered architecture with **Spring MVC**
- Database management with **MySQL**, **JDBC API**, **Spring Data JPA**
- Data manipulation with Python libraries **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**
- Web development with **RESTful APIs**, **Java Server Pages**, and **Java Servlets**
- Test-driven development, unit testing, and integration testing with **JUnit** and **Mockito**
- Cloud computing with **Amazon Web Services**
- Workflow management with **Agile**, **Jira**, and **Confluence**
- Management of the software development lifecycle with **Git** for version control and **Jenkins** CI/CD pipeline

My projects included the following:
- A set of microservices for a [Banking App](https://github.com/jbritland16/ClassroomExercises/tree/master/banking-application-jbritland16-master)
- A web-based [Stock Trading App](https://github.com/jbritland16/OrderBook) built by a team of which I was the scrum master and a working team member

#### Google Data Analytics certificate

After the Pioneers Programme, I continued to look for other opportunities to learn. One of my favourite opportunities came along in August 2023 
when I enrolled in the Google Data Analytics certificate program through Coursera. This programme taught me a variety of skills and tools for 
utilizing data to make better business decisions, including:
- The data analysis process
- **Microsoft Excel** (including VLOOKUP and pivot tables)
- **SQL**
- Google **BigQuery**
- **Tableau**
- **R** programming language with RStudio

I finished my coursework and case study and earned my certificate in October 2023; you can view my badge 
[here](https://www.credly.com/badges/7023b4de-2b79-4dd7-99c1-dbc6b19908c4/public_url). My case study was rather rushed as other opportunities came up as I was finishing 
the course, so I have plans to do a more comprehensive one later, but for now, you are welcome to view the case study [here](https://github.com/jmbritland/GoogleDataCapstone). 
I enjoyed this certificate and was drawn by R most of all; I plan to continue learning to analyze data using 
R and Python code after my current goals are met.

#### Other experiences

In addition to these structured experiences, I have learned additional coding skills in other environments. I learned **C++** during university and I continually find new learning 
opportunities online. In summer 2023, I completed the following courses through freecodecamp.org [(see my profile here)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/jbritland):
- **JavaScript** Algorithms and Data Structures, May 2023 [(see certificate and projects here)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jbritland/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures)
- Responsive Web Design with **HTML** and **CSS**, June 2023 [(see certificate and projects here)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jbritland/responsive-web-design)
- Front End Development Libraries focusing on **React.js** and **Redux.js**, July 2023 [(see certificate and projects here)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/jbritland/front-end-development-libraries)

I also began freeCodeCamp's Data Visualization course but put it on hold when I started the Google Data Analytics course. I plan to pick it up again later, but I am currently 
preparing for a possible opportunity in front-end development, so I am prioritizing JavaScript skills for now. I am updating previous projects with more refined user interfaces to 
develop and showcase these skills. I'll continue to update this page as I add skills and projects to my portfolio.

### My goals:

In the short-term, I am working toward landing a job in the tech industry where I can continue to develop existing and new skills. While I am most keen to learn about data, I am open to any related position as I want to learn any and all skills that I can and become a well-rounded engineer.

In five years, I would like to develop my skills in my employment and through open-source coding, focusing on healthcare/medical software where possible. Although I am not currently working in dietetics, health is still my passion and I want to contribute to the healthcare field in my own unique way. 

In ten to fifteen years, once I improve my coding skills, I hope to be admitted into a Masters in Biomedical Engineering program. I will use this to find employment creating technology to improve medical treatments.
