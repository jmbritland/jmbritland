# Hello there!

## I'm Julia Britland, an aspiring software engineer.

### My story:

I am from Utah, USA, but I am now based in London, England. I am a dietitian (RD) registered in the United States with a **BS in Food and Nutrition** from the University of Alabama (completed remotely while living near Atlanta, Georgia) and a **dietetic internship** completed at Virginia State University. I enjoy spending time with my husband Curtis ‚ù§Ô∏è, cooking/baking üç™, traveling ‚úàÔ∏è, playing video games üéÆ, reading classic novels üìñ, walks in the park üå≥, and West End theatre productions üé≠. I have always also been interested in data and technology and how they can be used to solve big problems, and this is why I recently decided to transition to a career in the tech field.

### My skills and learning:

Currently, I am a student in HyperionDev's **Software Engineering Bootcamp**. In this intensive 4-month program, we are learning:
- **Python**
- **Object-Oriented Programming**
- **SQL**
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **Django**
- **Natural Language Processing**
- **System anaylsis and design**
- **Data libraries**
- **Static and dynamic backend web development**
- **Source version control**
- **Management of software development lifecycle**

Additionally, I have previous experience with **C++** and I am independently learning to develop Python apps with **Tk**.

### My goals:

In the short-term, I am working toward landing a job in the software industry where I can develop my tech skills. While I am most keen to learn about data engineering, I am open to any related position as I want to learn any and all skills that I can and become a well-rounded engineer.

In five years, I would like to be in a more specialized position and become recognized as an expert at what I do. I will develop my skills in my employment and through open-source coding, focusing on healthcare/medical software where possible. Although I am not currently working in dietetics, health is still my passion and I want to contribute to the healthcare field in my own unique way. 

In ten to fifteen years, once I improve my coding skills, I hope to be admitted into a Masters in Biomedical Engineering program. I will use this to find employment developing medical software.
